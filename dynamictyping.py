# Unlike other languages, such as C#, you don't need to declare a data type in Python. C# is an example of static typing, where the data 
# type doesn't change and it won't take a string data type if you assign it to something like int a; Python has dynamic data typing, where you 
# can change the variable to a different data type and you won't have the interpreter complain.

# Still there are restrictions on naming your var. You can use a-z, A-Z, 0-9 (But you cannot start a var with a number), 
# _ (underscore is allowed) Cannot use: @, ?, %, *, + - Basically, any char that could be mistaken as an operator is not allowed.
